# Assignment 2 - MLP with TensorBoard
## Submission Details
* An MLP training script using tf.data
* A description of what the six shuffle/batch/repeat orderings do (on a conceptual level) and which one you think is the most sensible for training neural networks.
* For each “failed” script above, a description of the problem as well as how to fix it (there may be multiple ways). You can just write some text here (markdown cells!), but feel free to reinforce your ideas with some code snippets.
* Further details related to the task can be found in the below task URL.
