# Assignment 4 - DenseNets, Inception, ResNets
## Submission Details
* DenseNet. Thoroughly experiment with (hyper)parameters. Try to achieve the best performance you can on CIFAR10/100.
* For your model(s), compare performance with and without tf.function. You can also do this for non-DenseNet models. How does the impact depend on the size of the models?
* High-level Training Loops with Keras.
* Further details related to the task can be found in the below task URL.
