# Assignment 3 - Convolutional-Neural-Nets(CNN's)
## Submission Details
* A CNN (built with Keras) trained on MNIST (or not, see below). Also use Keras losses, optimizers and metrics, but do still use a “custom” training loop (with GradientTape).
* You are highly encouraged to move past MNIST at this point. E.g. switching to CIFAR takes minimal effort since it can also be downloaded through Keras. You can still use MNIST as a “sanity check” that your model is working, but you can skip it for the submission.
* Really do play with the model parameters. As a silly example, you could try increasing your filter sizes up to the input image size – think about what kind of network you are ending up with if you do this! On the other extreme, what about 1x1 filters?
